# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on integrating MongoDB into the Yad2 Apartment Notifier project. A detailed plan for this integration has been created and saved as `memory-bank/mongo_integration_plan.md`.

## Recent Changes

- Created the `memory-bank` directory.
- Created and populated the following core Memory Bank files:
    - `projectbrief.md`: Defined core project goals and functionality.
    - `productContext.md`: Outlined the project's purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals.
    - `techContext.md`: Detailed the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, and dependencies, inferred from project files.
    - `systemPatterns.md`: Described the system architecture, component relationships, and key technical decisions, largely based on `architecture.txt` and code structure.
- Created `memory-bank/mongo_integration_plan.md` detailing the steps for MongoDB integration.

## Next Steps

1.  Proceed with Phase 1 of the `mongo_integration_plan.md`: Setup and Basic Connectivity.
    *   Create `repositories/mongo_repository.py`.
    *   Install `pymongo`.
    *   Configure `MONGO_URI` in `.env` and `src/config.py`.
    *   Implement basic connection logic in `mongo_repository.py`.
2.  Continue through the phases outlined in `mongo_integration_plan.md`.
3.  Update `progress.md`, `techContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md` as the integration progresses.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The content for the Memory Bank files is being inferred from the provided project files (code, README, planning documents). The accuracy of this inference depends on the completeness and correctness of these source files.
- The primary goal of this current activity is to establish a baseline Memory Bank. Future updates will refine these documents as development progresses or new insights are gained.
